## Install

```sh
npm i @substrate-system/at
```

## Use

### `aka` command

Add a URL to your DID's `alsoKnownAs` property.

The `aka` command lets you link external URLs to your Bluesky DID document.
This is useful for connecting your Bluesky identity to other online profiles
like GitHub or any other website.

If you did not install this glabally via `npm i -g @substrate-system/at`,
then use `npx` to execute the program.

```bash
npx at aka <handle> <URL> [--pds <custom-pds>]
```

**Arguments**

- `<handle>` - Your Bluesky handle (e.g., `alice.bsky.social`)
- `<URL>` - The URL to link (e.g., `https://github.com/alice`)
- `--pds` - (Optional) Custom PDS server URL. Defaults to `https://bsky.social`


### Example

Link to your github profile.

```sh
at aka alice.bsky.social https://github.com/alice
```

This command will:
1. Prompt you for your Bluesky password
2. Send a verification code to your email
3. Ask you to enter the verification code
4. Update your DID document so that it includes your GitHub URL in
   the `alsoKnownAs` property

The resulting `alsoKnownAs` array in your DID document will contain:

```js
[
  "at://alice.bsky.social",
  "https://github.com/alice"
]
```

### Using a custom PDS

Pass in the `--pds` argument with PDS URL.

```sh
at aka alice.example.com https://alice.com --pds https://pds.example.com
```

## How it works

The AT Protocol uses [DID (Decentralized Identifier)](https://atproto.com/specs/did)
documents to represent user identities. Each DID document can include an
`alsoKnownAs` field that links to other identifiers or URLs.

This uses the [@atproto/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)
client.
